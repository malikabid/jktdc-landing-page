          <h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> About Aru Valley</h2>
          <p>
            Aru Valley is a picturesque village and meadow located approximately
            12 kilometers upstream from Pahalgam in the Anantnag district.
            Situated at an altitude of 2,408 meters (7,900 feet), this serene
            valley serves as the base camp for some of Kashmir's most
            spectacular treks, including the famous Tarsar-Marsar Lake Trek,
            Kolahoi Glacier Trek, and Lidderwat Valley Trek. The valley offers a
            perfect blend of natural beauty and adventure opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The valley is characterized by vast meadows surrounded by coniferous
            forests, with the Aru River (a tributary of Lidder River) flowing
            through it. Unlike the more commercialized Pahalgam, Aru retains its
            rustic charm with traditional wooden houses, grazing shepherds, and
            unspoiled landscapes. The valley transforms dramatically with
            seasons - lush green in summer, golden in autumn, and snow-covered
            in winter, each offering a unique experience to visitors.
