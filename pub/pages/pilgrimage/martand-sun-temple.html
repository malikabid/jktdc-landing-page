          <h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> About Martand Sun Temple</h2>
          <p>
            The Martand Sun Temple, dedicated to Surya (the Sun God), is one of
            the most magnificent examples of ancient Kashmiri architecture.
            Built in the 8th century AD by King Lalitaditya Muktapida of the
            Karkota Dynasty, this temple complex stands as a testament to
            Kashmir's rich Hindu heritage and advanced architectural knowledge.
            Located near Anantnag, about 64 km from Srinagar, the temple sits on
            a plateau overlooking the beautiful Kashmir Valley.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though now in ruins, the temple's grandeur is still evident in its
            massive stone structures, intricate carvings, and strategic
            architectural design. The name "Martand" is another name for the Sun
            God in Sanskrit. Despite being partially destroyed in the 15th
            century, the temple remains an important archaeological site and a
            popular tourist destination, offering breathtaking panoramic views
            of the surrounding landscape.

          <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark"></i> Historical Significance</h2>
          <p>
            King Lalitaditya Muktapida, one of Kashmir's most powerful rulers,
            commissioned the construction of this magnificent temple during the
            height of the Karkota Dynasty. The temple was built using massive
            limestone blocks, each weighing several tons, transported from
            distant quarries. The construction showcases advanced engineering
            techniques and astronomical knowledge of the era.
          </p>
          <p>
            The temple functioned as an important pilgrimage site for over 700
            years until it was destroyed by Sultan Sikandar Butshikan in the
            early 15th century as part of his iconoclastic campaign. Despite the
            destruction, the temple's ruins continue to inspire awe and remain
            one of the most visited heritage sites in Kashmir. The
            Archaeological Survey of India has undertaken preservation efforts
            to protect this invaluable historical monument.

          <p>
            The Martand Temple complex is built on a raised platform measuring
            approximately 220 feet × 142 feet, with the main shrine in the
            center surrounded by a colonnaded courtyard. The temple exhibits a
            unique blend of Kashmiri architectural style with influences from
            Gandharan and Greek architecture, reflecting Kashmir's position on
            ancient trade routes.
