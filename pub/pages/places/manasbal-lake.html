          <h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> About Manasbal Lake</h2>
          <p>
            Manasbal Lake, located in the Ganderbal district about 30 kilometers
            north of Srinagar, is renowned as the deepest natural lake in Jammu
            and Kashmir, with depths reaching up to 13 meters (43 feet). Often
            called the "Supreme Gem of all Kashmir Lakes" by Mughal emperors,
            this pristine water body is celebrated for its crystal-clear waters,
            stunning lotus blooms, and tranquil surroundings. The lake covers an
            area of approximately 2.81 square kilometers and is surrounded by
            picturesque villages and lush green mountains.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lake is particularly famous for its lotus flowers that bloom
            abundantly during July and August, covering large sections of the
            lake surface with beautiful pink and white blossoms. Ancient ruins
            of a Mughal garden built by Nur Jahan stand on its shores, adding
            historical significance to its natural beauty. The lake is a haven
            for bird watchers, with numerous migratory birds visiting during
            winter, and offers excellent opportunities for boating, fishing, and
            photography.
