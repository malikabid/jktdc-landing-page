          <p>
            The Amarnath Cave, located at an altitude of 3,888 meters (12,756
            feet) in the Himalayas, is one of the most revered Hindu pilgrimage
            sites in the world. Situated in the Anantnag district, approximately
            141 km from Srinagar, this sacred cave houses a naturally formed ice
            Shiva Lingam (symbol of Lord Shiva) that waxes and wanes with the
            phases of the moon.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Hindu mythology, this is the place where Lord Shiva
            revealed the secret of immortality (Amar Katha) to his consort
            Goddess Parvati. Every year, hundreds of thousands of devotees
            undertake the arduous Amarnath Yatra (pilgrimage) to witness the
            divine ice lingam and seek the blessings of Lord Shiva. The yatra is
            considered one of the most challenging yet spiritually rewarding
            pilgrimages in Hinduism.

          <h2><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> Legend & Mythology</h2>
          <p>
            According to ancient Hindu texts and local folklore, Lord Shiva
            chose this remote cave to reveal the secret of immortality (Amar
            Katha) to Goddess Parvati. Before narrating the secret, Lord Shiva
            left behind all his possessions at various points: the sacred bull
            Nandi at Pahalgam, the crescent moon at Chandanwari, his serpents at
            Lake Sheshnag, and his son Ganesha at Mahagunas Parbat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Legend says that a pair of doves (kabootar) overheard the secret of
            immortality and became immortal. Many pilgrims claim to have sighted
            these white doves inside the cave, which is considered an auspicious
            sign. The natural formation of the ice lingam, which grows and
            shrinks with the lunar cycle, is considered a divine manifestation
            of Lord Shiva himself.

            <li>Start physical preparation at least 2-3 months in advance.</li>
            <li>
              Acclimatize properly - spend a day at Pahalgam or Baltal before
              starting the trek.
            </li>
            <li>
              Walk slowly and steadily - this is not a race. Take frequent
              breaks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stay hydrated but avoid excessive water intake which can lead to
              Acute Mountain Sickness.
            </li>
            <li>
              Listen to your body - if you feel unwell, descend immediately and
              seek medical help.
            </li>
            <li>
              Follow the instructions of SASB officials and security personnel.
            </li>
            <li>
              Respect the environment - do not litter. Use designated dustbins.
            </li>
            <li>
              Travel light - carry only essentials. Excess luggage will make the
              trek difficult.
            </li>
            <li>
              Group travel is safer - stay with your group and inform someone of
              your whereabouts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Weather can change suddenly - be prepared for rain, snow, or
              extreme cold anytime.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mobile connectivity may be limited or unavailable at higher
              altitudes.
            </li>
            <li>Carry photocopies of important documents as backups.</li>
            <li>
              Sunrise view from the cave is spectacular - plan to reach early if

          <h2><i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i> Yatra Schedule</h2>
          <p>
            The Amarnath Yatra typically begins in late June or early July
            (depending on weather conditions) and continues for about 45 days
            through the Hindu month of Shravan (July-August). The exact dates
            are announced by the Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board several months in
            advance.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> The ice lingam is at its peak size on
            the full moon day of Shravan (Shravan Purnima or Raksha Bandhan),
            which is considered the most auspicious day for the pilgrimage.
            However, this day also sees the maximum rush of pilgrims. Plan
            accordingly based on your preferences for spiritual significance
            versus crowd management.
