          <h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> About Yusmarg</h2>
          <p>
            Yusmarg, meaning "Meadow of Jesus," is a breathtaking hill station
            located in the Budgam district, approximately 47 kilometers south of
            Srinagar. This picturesque meadow sits in a basin surrounded by
            dense pine and fir forests at an altitude of 2,400 meters. Unlike
            more commercialized destinations, Yusmarg retains its pristine charm
            and offers visitors an authentic experience of Kashmir's natural
            beauty.
          </p>
          <p>
            The meadow is surrounded by snow-capped peaks of the Pir Panjal
            range, creating a spectacular amphitheater of mountains. During
            spring and summer, the vast green expanses are dotted with colorful
            wildflowers, while winter transforms it into a snowy wonderland. The
            area is relatively unexplored, making it perfect for those seeking
            solitude and untouched natural beauty.
