          <p>
            The Dastgeer Sahib shrine, located in the Khanyar area of downtown
            Srinagar, is dedicated to the revered Sufi saint Hazrat Sheikh Abdul
            Qadir Jilani (also known as Ghaus-ul-Azam). Though the saint lived
            in Baghdad in the 11th-12th century, his spiritual influence spread
            across the world, and this shrine serves as a major center of
            devotion for his followers in Kashmir.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shrine complex features beautiful Islamic architecture and is
            one of the most important Sufi shrines in Kashmir. The original
            wooden structure was tragically destroyed by fire in 2012, but it
            has been rebuilt maintaining its traditional architectural style
            while incorporating modern safety measures. The shrine continues to
            attract thousands of devotees who come to seek blessings and
            spiritual solace.

            <i class="fas fa-landmark"></i> Historical & Spiritual Significance
          </h2>
          <p>
            Hazrat Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani (1077-1166 AD) was a renowned
            Islamic scholar, preacher, and Sufi saint who founded the Qadiriyya
            order of Sufism. His teachings emphasized devotion to God, service
            to humanity, and spiritual purification. Though he lived in Baghdad,
            his spiritual influence reached Kashmir through his disciples and
            followers who established this shrine in his honor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shrine houses a relic believed to be associated with the saint -
            a hair strand that is displayed on special occasions. The shrine has
            been a center of Islamic learning and spirituality for centuries.
            The tragic fire of 2012 that destroyed the original structure was
            deeply mourned by the entire Kashmiri community, and the rebuilt
            shrine stands as a symbol of resilience and unwavering faith.
