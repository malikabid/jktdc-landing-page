          <p>
            Shopian district, carved out from Pulwama in 2007, is often referred
            to as the "Apple Bowl of Kashmir" due to its extensive apple
            cultivation. Located in southern Kashmir, the district is
            characterized by lush green landscapes, fruit orchards, and
            picturesque villages. The name "Shopian" is believed to be derived
            from "Shopyon," meaning "the meeting place" in local dialect.
          </p>
          <p>
            The district is blessed with abundant natural springs, making it one
            of the most fertile regions in Kashmir. Approximately 80% of the
            population is engaged in horticulture, primarily apple cultivation.
            Besides apples, the region produces walnuts, cherries, and pears.
            Shopian offers immense potential for agro-tourism, eco-tourism, and
            adventure activities with its pristine forests and wildlife
            sanctuaries.
