          <p>
            Pulwama district, often called the "Rice Bowl" and "Saffron Bowl" of
            Kashmir, is located in southern Kashmir Valley on the banks of the
            Jhelum River. The district is renowned for its vast saffron
            cultivation, particularly in the Pampore region, which produces some
            of the world's finest saffron. The name "Pulwama" is believed to
            derive from the Sanskrit words "Pul" (bridge) and "Wam" (hamlet).
          </p>
          <p>
            The district boasts rich agricultural lands, historic ruins, and
            stunning natural landscapes. Pampore is famous not only for saffron
            but also for the majestic Awantipora temple ruins, reflecting
            Kashmir's ancient Hindu heritage. Pulwama offers visitors a unique
            blend of agricultural tourism, historical exploration, and scenic
            beauty with its meadows, springs, and apple orchards.
