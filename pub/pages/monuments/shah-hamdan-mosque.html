          <p>
            Shah Hamdan Mosque, also known as Khanqah-e-Moula, is one of the
            oldest and most revered mosques in Srinagar. Located on the banks of
            the Jhelum River in the heart of the old city, this historic mosque
            was originally built in 1395 AD to commemorate the visit of Mir Syed
            Ali Hamdani (Shah-e-Hamadan), the Persian Sufi saint who played a
            pivotal role in spreading Islam in Kashmir. The mosque is a
            masterpiece of Kashmiri wooden architecture and craftsmanship.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mosque showcases exquisite Kashmiri wood carving with intricate
            papier-mâché work on its ceiling and walls. The building features
            beautiful calligraphy, floral motifs, and geometric patterns that
            represent the finest examples of Islamic art in Kashmir. Though the
            structure has been rebuilt several times due to fires, the most
            recent restoration in 1732 AD maintained its original architectural
            style. The mosque houses a relic believed to be a hair strand of
            Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), making it one of the most sacred Islamic
            sites in the region.
