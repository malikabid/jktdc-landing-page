          <p>
            The Mughal Gardens of Kashmir are stunning examples of
            Persian-inspired garden design, created by Mughal emperors during
            the 16th and 17th centuries. These terraced gardens, built along the
            eastern shores of Dal Lake and other scenic locations, represent the
            zenith of Mughal horticultural art and architecture. The gardens
            follow the traditional Persian Charbagh (four-quadrant) style,
            featuring flowing water channels, fountains, pavilions, and
            carefully manicured flower beds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kashmir's Mughal Gardens are not just botanical wonders but also
            architectural masterpieces that reflect the Mughal emperors' love
            for nature and their vision of creating paradise on earth. The main
            gardens include Shalimar Bagh (Abode of Love), Nishat Bagh (Garden
            of Joy), Chashme Shahi (Royal Spring), and several others. Each
            garden has its unique character, historical significance, and
            stunning views of Dal Lake and the surrounding Zabarwan mountains.
            These gardens continue to enchant visitors with their serene beauty,
            historical significance, and timeless elegance.
