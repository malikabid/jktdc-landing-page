          <p>
            Betaab Valley, originally known as Hajan Valley or Hagan Valley, was
            renamed after the 1983 Bollywood film "Betaab" starring Sunny Deol
            and Amrita Singh was shot here. Located 15 kilometers from Pahalgam
            in the Anantnag district, this stunning valley has become one of
            Kashmir's most photographed and visited destinations. The valley's
            picturesque beauty with its lush greenery, crystal-clear streams,
            and snow-capped mountain backdrop has made it a favorite location
            for Bollywood filmmakers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Situated at an altitude of about 2,400 meters, Betaab Valley is
            surrounded by dense forests of pine and deodar trees, with the
            Lidder River flowing through it. The valley floor is covered with
            vibrant green meadows that come alive with colorful wildflowers in
            spring and summer. The dramatic landscape, with towering mountains
            on all sides, creates a natural amphitheater that's perfect for
            picnics, photography, and simply soaking in the breathtaking
            scenery.
