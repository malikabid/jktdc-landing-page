          <p>
            Ganderbal district is located in central Kashmir and serves as the
            gateway to Ladakh via the Zoji La pass on NH1. The district is
            blessed with extraordinary natural beauty, featuring glaciers,
            alpine lakes, and the famous Sind Valley. The name "Ganderbal" is
            derived from "Gandar Bal," meaning "strong man," reflecting the
            region's rugged terrain and resilient people.
          </p>
          <p>
            The district is famous for its trout fishing, adventure tourism, and
            pilgrimage destinations. Sonamarg (Meadow of Gold), one of Kashmir's
            most popular tourist destinations, is located in this district. The
            region experiences extreme weather conditions and remains cut off
            during heavy winter snowfall.
