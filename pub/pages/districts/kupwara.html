          <p>
            Kupwara district is located in the northwestern part of Kashmir
            Valley and shares its border with Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
            Known for its untouched natural beauty, the district encompasses
            some of Kashmir's most pristine valleys including Lolab, Machil,
            Keran, and Bangus. The name "Kupwara" is believed to be derived from
            Sanskrit "Kupu-pur," meaning "the town of Kupu," an ancient sage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite its proximity to the Line of Control, Kupwara offers immense
            tourism potential with its virgin landscapes, alpine meadows, and
            diverse wildlife. The district is home to several endangered species
            and features the famous Bangus Valley, often compared to Switzerland
            for its scenic beauty. Rich in biodiversity, the region is perfect
            for eco-tourism and adventure activities.
