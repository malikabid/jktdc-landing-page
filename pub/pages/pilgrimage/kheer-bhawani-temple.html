          <p>
            Kheer Bhawani Temple, also known as Ragnya Devi Temple, is one of
            the most revered Hindu shrines in Kashmir, dedicated to Goddess
            Ragnya Devi (a manifestation of Goddess Durga). Located in the
            village of Tulmulla in Ganderbal district, about 27 km from
            Srinagar, this temple is centered around a sacred spring whose
            waters are believed to change colors, reflecting the well-being of
            Kashmir and its people.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name "Kheer Bhawani" comes from the tradition of offering Kheer
            (a sweet rice pudding) to the goddess. Kashmiri Pandits consider
            this temple as one of their most important pilgrimage sites. The
            temple complex features a beautiful octagonal marble structure built
            around the sacred spring, with a small island in the center where
            the goddess is worshipped. The serene surroundings, lined with
            majestic chinar trees, add to the temple's spiritual ambiance.

          </h2>
          <p>
            The temple has been a center of worship for Kashmiri Hindus for over
            a thousand years. Ancient texts and oral traditions speak of the
            goddess appearing in dreams to devotees, guiding them to this sacred
            spring. The temple is considered a Shakti Peeth, making it one of
            the holiest sites in Hindu tradition.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most fascinating aspect of the temple is the sacred spring whose
            waters mysteriously change colors from white to green, blue, or even
            black. According to local belief, these color changes are omens -
            white signifies peace and prosperity, green indicates prosperity,
            while darker colors are considered warnings. During the exodus of
            Kashmiri Pandits in the 1990s, many devotees reported seeing the
            water turn dark, lending credence to the mystical beliefs
            surrounding the spring.

          <p>
            According to legend, Goddess Parvati appeared in different forms
            across Kashmir, and one of her manifestations was as Ragnya Devi at
            this spring. The goddess is believed to protect devotees and fulfill
            their wishes. The spring itself is considered to be a manifestation
            of the goddess's divine power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Local folklore tells of various miracles associated with the temple,
            including devotees being cured of illnesses and prayers being
            answered. The belief in the sacred spring's prophetic color changes
            has been passed down through generations. Many Kashmiri Pandits,
            despite living far from Kashmir, make it a point to visit during the
            annual festival, maintaining their deep connection with this holy
            site.
