          <p>
            Hazratbal Shrine, located on the northern shores of the pristine Dal
            Lake in Srinagar, is one of the most revered Muslim shrines in
            Kashmir. The shrine houses the Moi-e-Muqqadas (Holy Relic), believed
            to be a hair strand of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). The name
            "Hazratbal" literally means "Respected Place," reflecting its
            profound religious significance for Muslims worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shrine's distinctive white marble architecture creates a
            stunning visual contrast against the backdrop of the majestic
            Zabarwan Mountains and the serene waters of Dal Lake. Built in the
            Mughal style with modern additions, the shrine features a beautiful
            dome and elegant minarets that can be seen from various vantage
            points around Srinagar. The peaceful setting and spiritual ambiance
            make it a major pilgrimage destination, especially during important
            Islamic occasions.
