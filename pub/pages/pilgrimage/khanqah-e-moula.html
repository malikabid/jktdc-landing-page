          <p>
            Khanqah-e-Moula, also known as Shah-e-Hamadan mosque, is one of the
            most revered Islamic shrines in Kashmir. Located on the banks of the
            Jhelum River in old Srinagar, it is dedicated to Mir Syed Ali
            Hamadani (1314-1384 AD), a Persian Sufi saint and scholar who played
            a pivotal role in spreading Islam and establishing Islamic culture
            in Kashmir. This historic khanqah (Sufi monastery) is Kashmir's
            oldest Muslim shrine and a masterpiece of traditional Kashmiri
            architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            The building is an architectural marvel, constructed entirely of
            wood with intricate papier-mâché work, beautiful calligraphy, and
            traditional Kashmiri craftsmanship. The shrine has survived multiple
            fires throughout history and has been rebuilt each time by devoted
            followers, maintaining its original architectural style. The serene
            location on the Jhelum riverbank and the spiritual ambiance make it
            one of Srinagar's most significant cultural and religious landmarks.

          </h2>
          <p>
            Mir Syed Ali Hamadani, known as Shah-e-Hamadan (King of Hamadan),
            was a renowned Persian Sufi saint, scholar, poet, and propagator of
            Islam. He visited Kashmir three times between 1372 and 1384 AD,
            bringing with him 700 Sayyids (descendants of Prophet Muhammad) who
            were scholars, craftsmen, and mystics. His arrival marked a
            significant turning point in Kashmir's history, as he laid the
            foundation of Islamic culture, introduced various crafts (including
            shawl-making and papier-mâché), and established educational
            institutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Khanqah was built at the site where the saint is believed to
            have stayed during his visits. It became the center of Islamic
            learning and Sufi practices in Kashmir. Shah-e-Hamadan's teachings
            emphasized moral living, devotion to God, and service to humanity.
            His influence on Kashmiri society was so profound that he is often
            credited with shaping Kashmir's Islamic identity while promoting
            harmony and peaceful coexistence. The shrine has withstood numerous
            fires (1479, 1731, 1994, 2010) but has been rebuilt each time with
            the same dedication and craftsmanship.
