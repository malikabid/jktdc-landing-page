          <p>
            Doodhpathri, meaning "Valley of Milk," is a pristine meadow located
            in the Budgam district of Kashmir, approximately 42 kilometers from
            Srinagar. The name derives from the milky-white appearance of the
            streams flowing through the valley, created by the gushing waters
            over limestone rocks. This relatively less-explored destination
            offers unspoiled natural beauty, making it perfect for those seeking
            tranquility away from crowded tourist spots.
          </p>
          <p>
            Situated at an altitude of 2,730 meters (8,957 feet), Doodhpathri is
            surrounded by dense pine forests and snow-capped peaks. The meadow
            is carpeted with wildflowers during spring and summer, creating a
            spectacular canvas of colors. The area remains covered in snow
            during winter, transforming into a winter wonderland accessible only
            from May to October.

                  The main stream flowing through Doodhpathri, known for its
                  crystal-clear milky-white water. The stream originates from
                  snow-fed springs and flows through meadows, creating a
                  mesmerizing sight. Perfect spot for photography and relaxation
                  by the waterside.

                  Doodhpathri serves as the gateway to Tosa Maidan, another
                  beautiful meadow. The trek between these two destinations
                  offers stunning Himalayan views, wildflower meadows, and
                  encounters with local shepherds. A perfect multi-day trekking

                <p>
                  Dense coniferous forests surround the meadow, providing shade
                  and enhancing the scenic beauty. The forest trails are perfect
                  for nature walks and bird watching. In spring, the forest
                  floor is covered with colorful wildflowers and mushrooms.
