          <p>
            Kulgam district is located in southern Kashmir and carved out from
            Anantnag district in 2007. The district is known for its religious
            harmony, with numerous Hindu and Muslim shrines coexisting
            peacefully. Kulgam means "home of pots" in Kashmiri, reflecting its
            historical pottery tradition. The region is blessed with natural
            springs, lush green forests, and fertile agricultural land.
          </p>
          <p>
            The district is famous for its saffron cultivation, walnut
            production, and traditional crafts. Aharbal waterfall, often called
            the "Niagara Falls of Kashmir," is one of the district's prime
            tourist attractions. Kulgam offers a perfect blend of natural
            beauty, religious tourism, and rural Kashmiri culture, making it an
            emerging tourist destination.
