          <p>
            Sonamarg, meaning "Meadow of Gold," is a breathtaking hill station
            located in the Ganderbal district of Jammu and Kashmir. Situated at
            an altitude of 2,800 meters (9,186 feet) in the Kashmir Valley, this
            alpine paradise is renowned for its spectacular landscapes featuring
            snow-capped peaks, glaciers, pristine lakes, and lush meadows.
            During spring and summer, the meadows are covered with flowers that
            give the valley its golden appearance, justifying its poetic name.
          </p>
          <p>
            Located 80 kilometers from Srinagar on the Srinagar-Leh highway,
            Sonamarg serves as a base for several treks and is the gateway to
            the famous Amarnath Cave pilgrimage via the Baltal route. Surrounded
            by majestic Himalayan peaks and fed by the Sindh River, Sonamarg
            offers adventure enthusiasts opportunities for trekking, camping,
            fishing, and white-water rafting. The area remains snow-covered for
            much of the year, transforming into a stunning landscape of
            glaciers, alpine meadows, and crystal-clear mountain streams during
            the brief summer months.

                JKSRTC operates regular bus services from Srinagar to Sonamarg
                during the open season (May-October). Journey takes about 3
                hours. Economical option but less flexible. Book tickets in
                advance during peak season. Some buses continue to Kargil and
                Leh.

            <li>
              Sonamarg is accessible only from May to October. The area remains
              closed from November to April due to heavy snowfall and extreme
              weather conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              The new Zoji La tunnel (under construction) will be Asia's longest
              bi-directional tunnel, ensuring year-round connectivity between
              Kashmir and Ladakh.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mobile network connectivity is limited. BSNL has better coverage
              than other operators. Carry sufficient cash as ATMs are not
              available.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Sindh River is fed by glaciers and melting snow. Its water
              temperature remains very cold throughout the year - not suitable
              for swimming.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the Amarnath Yatra season (July-August), Baltal base camp
              transforms into a temporary township with thousands of pilgrims.
            </li>
            <li>
              The area falls under environmentally sensitive zones. Avoid
              littering and respect the fragile mountain ecosystem.
            </li>
            <li>
              Weather can change dramatically within hours. Always carry rain
              gear, warm clothes, and sun protection even on clear days.
            </li>
            <li>
              The name "Sonamarg" was given due to the golden color of the
              meadows when wildflowers bloom in spring and summer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sonamarg is on the ancient Silk Route that connected Kashmir with
              Central Asia and Tibet.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Kashmir Great Lakes Trek, starting from Sonamarg, is rated
              among the best alpine treks in India.
            </li>
            <li>
              For multi-day treks and expeditions, hiring experienced local
              guides is essential for safety and navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              The area is prone to altitude sickness. Ascend gradually, stay
              hydrated, and descend immediately if symptoms appear.
            </li>
            <li>
              Photography permits may be required near strategic locations and
              military installations. Check with local authorities.

                  blooms and bird watching. A detour worth taking for its serene
