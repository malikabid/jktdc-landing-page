          <p>
            Dal Lake, often referred to as the "Jewel in the crown of Kashmir,"
            is the second-largest lake in the union territory of Jammu and
            Kashmir. This iconic water body is not just a tourist attraction but
            an integral part of Srinagar's cultural and economic fabric. Spread
            over 18 square kilometers, Dal Lake is famous for its intricate
            system of waterways, floating gardens known as "Rad," and
            traditional houseboats.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lake is surrounded by the majestic Zabarwan mountain range on
            three sides, with the Mughal gardens of Nishat Bagh and Shalimar
            Bagh adorning its shores. The shimmering waters reflect the changing
            colors of the sky, creating a mesmerizing spectacle throughout the
            day. The unique lifestyle of the lake's inhabitants, who live in
            houseboats and run floating markets, adds to the lake's distinctive
            character and charm.
