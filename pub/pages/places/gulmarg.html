          <p>
            Gulmarg, literally meaning "Meadow of Flowers," is a picturesque
            hill station and one of Asia's premier ski resorts, located in the
            Baramulla district of Jammu and Kashmir. Situated at an altitude of
            2,650 meters (8,694 feet) above sea level, this stunning destination
            transforms from a lush green meadow carpeted with wildflowers in
            summer to a pristine white winter wonderland covered in snow from
            December to March.
          </p>
          <p>
            Home to the world's highest cable car, the Gulmarg Gondola, this
            destination attracts adventure enthusiasts, nature lovers, and
            families throughout the year. The snow-capped peaks, including the
            majestic Apharwat Peak at 4,200 meters, offer breathtaking panoramic
            views of the Himalayas. Gulmarg has evolved from a summer resort
            established by the British in 1927 to become one of the most
            sought-after ski destinations in Asia, offering world-class
            infrastructure for skiing, snowboarding, and various adventure
            sports.

              Gondola operations are weather-dependent and may be suspended

              The name "Gulmarg" was given by Sultan Yusuf Shah in the 16th
