          <p>
            Verinag Springs, located in the Anantnag district, is the primary
            source of the Jhelum River. This pristine natural spring emerges
            from the base of a hill and forms a beautiful octagonal pool. The
            name "Verinag" is derived from Sanskrit "Nila Naga" meaning "blue
            serpent," referring to the spring's deep blue waters. The spring has
            been revered since ancient times and is mentioned in historical
            texts as one of Kashmir's most sacred water sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Emperor Jahangir, captivated by the spring's beauty during his visit
            in 1620 AD, commissioned the construction of an elegant octagonal
            stone basin and a garden around it. His son, Emperor Shah Jahan,
            later enhanced the site by adding an arcade of 24 arches around the
            spring. The garden features terraced lawns, Chinar trees, and
            perfectly aligned water channels. The crystal-clear water flows from
            the spring at a constant rate throughout the year, maintaining its
            pristine quality and sacred significance.
