            of Sufism in Kashmir and is Kashmir's patron saint. His teachings

          </h2>
          <p>
            Sheikh Noor-ud-din Noorani (1377-1440 AD) was a philosopher, poet,
            and mystic who dedicated his life to spreading the message of peace,
            harmony, and spirituality. His verses (known as Shruk) in Kashmiri
            language form an important part of Kashmir's spiritual and literary
            heritage. He advocated vegetarianism, simple living, and harmony
            between Hindus and Muslims, making him a unifying figure in Kashmiri
            society.
          </p>
          <p>
            The original shrine was tragically destroyed by fire in 1995 but was
            rebuilt maintaining its traditional architectural style. The new
            structure preserves the spiritual essence while incorporating modern
            safety features. The shrine stands as a symbol of Kashmir's
            composite culture and the saint's enduring message of universal
            brotherhood.
