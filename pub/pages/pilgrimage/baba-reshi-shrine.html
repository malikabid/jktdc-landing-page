          <p>
            Nestled in the scenic pine forests of Gulmarg, approximately 45 km
            from Srinagar, the Baba Reshi shrine is dedicated to Baba Payamuddin
            Reshi (also known as Baba Reshi), a revered Sufi saint who lived in
            the 15th-16th century. Born as Payamuddin Pora, he served as a
            courtier in the court of King Zain-ul-Abidin (Budshah), but
            renounced worldly life to pursue spiritual enlightenment. He spent
            his later years in meditation and prayer in the solitude of these
            mountains.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shrine is located on the way to Gulmarg, surrounded by dense
            pine and fir forests at an altitude of about 2,195 meters. The
            natural setting adds to the spiritual ambiance - the sound of wind
            through pine trees, mountain streams, and bird songs create a
            meditative atmosphere. The shrine is an important pilgrimage site
            and also attracts tourists visiting Gulmarg who stop to pay respects
            and enjoy the serene environment and beautiful architecture.

            <i class="fas fa-landmark"></i> Historical & Spiritual Significance
          </h2>
          <p>
            Baba Payamuddin Reshi was born in the village of Pora in Kashmir in
            the 15th century. He was educated in Islamic theology and Persian
            literature and became a courtier in the court of the liberal and
            enlightened King Zain-ul-Abidin, also known as "Badshah" (Great
            King). Despite his position of privilege and comfort, Baba
            Payamuddin felt a calling toward spiritual life.
          </p>
          <p>
            He renounced his courtly life and position, choosing instead the
            path of a Sufi ascetic. He retreated to the forests of what is now
            the Gulmarg area, where he spent decades in meditation, prayer, and
            spiritual contemplation. He became known for his piety, wisdom, and
            miracles. People from near and far would come to seek his blessings
            and spiritual guidance. His teachings emphasized renunciation of
            worldly desires, devotion to God, and compassion for all living
            beings. The shrine built at his burial site has become an important
            pilgrimage destination, attracting devotees who seek spiritual
            solace in the same forests where the saint once meditated.
