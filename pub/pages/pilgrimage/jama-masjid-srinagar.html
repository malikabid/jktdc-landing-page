          <p>
            Jama Masjid Srinagar, located in the heart of the old city at
            Nowhatta, is one of the largest and most magnificent mosques in
            Kashmir. Built in 1402 AD by Sultan Sikandar Shah Miri (Sikandar
            Butshikan), the mosque is a masterpiece of Indo-Saracenic
            architecture featuring 378 wooden pillars, each made from a single
            deodar tree.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mosque can accommodate over 33,000 worshippers at a time, making
            it one of the largest mosques in India. The courtyard, covering
            approximately 384 feet x 381 feet, is surrounded by beautiful arched
            colonnades. The architectural style blends Persian influences with
            local Kashmiri craftsmanship, creating a unique and awe-inspiring
            structure.

          <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark"></i> Historical Significance</h2>
          <p>
            The mosque has witnessed Kashmir's tumultuous history, surviving
            three major fires in 1479, 1620, and 1674. Each time, it was rebuilt
            and restored by subsequent rulers. The current structure reflects
            renovations from different periods, particularly under the Mughal
            and Dogra rulers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout history, Jama Masjid has been not just a place of worship
            but also a center for social and political gatherings. It has played
            a significant role in Kashmir's cultural and religious life for over
            six centuries. The mosque's historical importance makes it a
            must-visit for those interested in Islamic architecture and
            Kashmir's heritage.
