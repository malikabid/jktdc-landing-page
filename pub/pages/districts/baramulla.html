          <p>
            Baramulla, also known as Varmul in ancient times, is one of the
            oldest towns in Kashmir Valley. Located at the northwestern end of
            the valley, it serves as the gateway to Kashmir and connects the
            valley with the rest of India via the Jhelum Valley Road. The
            district is blessed with abundant natural beauty, including vast
            apple orchards, walnut groves, and the mighty Jhelum River flowing
            through its heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            Baramulla is historically significant as a major trade center and
            has been an important town since ancient times. The district is home
            to several tourist destinations including Gulmarg (world-famous ski
            resort), Uri, and numerous religious and historical sites.
