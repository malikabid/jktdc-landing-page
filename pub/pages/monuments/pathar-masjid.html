          <p>
            Pathar Masjid, meaning "Stone Mosque," is an architectural marvel
            located near Nowhatta in the heart of Srinagar's old city. Built
            entirely of stone in 1623 AD by Empress Nur Jahan, the wife of
            Mughal Emperor Jahangir, this mosque stands out for its unique
            construction style. Unlike other mosques in Kashmir which are
            typically built with wood, Pathar Masjid features stone masonry
            throughout, showcasing a blend of Persian, Mughal, and Kashmiri
            architectural elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mosque is renowned for its impressive stone pillars, intricate
            carvings, and geometric patterns that adorn its walls and ceilings.
            The structure features a spacious courtyard and prayer hall with
            beautifully carved stone arches and pillars. Despite being over 400
            years old, the mosque has withstood earthquakes and the test of
            time, demonstrating the excellent craftsmanship of Mughal-era
            builders. The mosque remains an active place of worship and is an
            important heritage site representing Kashmir's rich Islamic
            architectural tradition.
