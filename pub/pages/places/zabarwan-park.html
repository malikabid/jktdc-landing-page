              <p>
                Sunrise (5:30-7:00 AM) and sunset (6:00-7:30 PM) provide the
                best natural lighting. The soft golden light enhances the
                landscapes and creates stunning silhouettes against the
                mountains.

              <p>
                The elevated viewing areas within the park offer unobstructed
                views of Dal Lake and the city. The open air theatre steps also
                provide excellent elevation for wide-angle shots.

              <h3><i class="fas fa-cloud"></i> Weather Considerations</h3>
              <p>
                Partly cloudy days create dramatic skies. After rain, the air is
                clearer, offering sharper mountain views. Morning mist over Dal
                Lake creates ethereal scenes perfect for atmospheric
                photography.

              <p>
                During cultural events, arrive early for good positions. The
                traditional Kashmiri attire and performances against the natural
                backdrop make for compelling cultural documentation.
